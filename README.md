# Personal Site (kenneth.kim)
When building my personal site, I knew I wanted it to show both my technical side and my creative side. Despite the fact that I only started to learn web development just a few weeks prior, I set my goals for a unique and highly interactive interface. The challange was to make something unique but still intuitive, which after some time, a map-themed interface the likes of Google Maps became my top candidate. Many months in, I have a working engine, but still have to add some content in.
