<p>Recently, I was jamming out with a group of friends when one of them started strumming “It Don’t Mean a Thing”. The strumming style was nothing like anything I’ve heard of before, and I asked what style it was. One of my other friends answered, “It’s called Gypsy Jazz, but I heard that word can be offensive, so I call it Romanian Jazz”. I chuckled because he obviously meant Roma, but then I started to wonder if the two words have a shared origin. Since I love reading about both cultures and etymology, it is natural that exonyms (names given to a group by people outside of the group) are extremely interesting to me. So it began - my rabbit hole into the etymology of Roma.</p>

<p>It turns out that, being a dispersed people, and possibly the most misunderstood people group on the planet, a vast number of names and terms have been used to describe the Roma people in multiple languages, and consequently, it has spun off a lot of words in English. To start, Roma comes from Rom, the word for “man of the Roma ethnic group” in the Romani language. Rom itself comes from Sanskrit, possibly from the word Doma which is a member of a low caste of travelling musicians and dancers. I never knew that the Roma were originally from the Indian subcontinent, but neither did the Roma nor the people they encountered. In English, the word Gypsy came from Gypcian, as it was thought that they came from Egypt. Similarly in Turkish and Arabic, they are called Kiptik, meaning Coptic. The French thought they were from Bohemia in modern-day Czechia and so called them Bohémien. This is where the English definition of Bohemianism being a very free and typically musical lifestyle surrounded by like-minded people is from. The Greeks called them Athínganos after somehow associating them with a small 9th century Christian sect from central Anatolia. This confusion comes from the fact that unlike pretty much any other people group, the Roma have never identified themselves with a territory and do not keep chronicles of their history. The finding that the Roma came from northwest India about 1,500 years ago came only from linguistic and genetic evidence starting in the nineteenth century. Because of this perceived lack of affiliation and the historical reluctance to integrate by Roma groups, Roma have often been seen as law-breakers, theives, and poverty, and have been persecuted from they arrived in Europe possibly as slaves, to the Great Gypsy Roundup in Spain in 1749, to the hundreds of thousands killed in the Holocaust, to the growing anti-Romani sentiment in Italy.</p>

<p>The name of the country Romania has nothing to do with the Roma, as it means “Roman Realm”. (Interestingly, though Rome equally conquered other areas surrounding Romania like Bulgaria and Serbia, the Romanian people probably named themselves in reference to the fact that their language is the only Romance language around them. The question of why only (Daco-) Romanian survived as a major Romance language in Eastern Europe while every other culture around them adoptic Slavic languages (besides the champion of outliers: Uralic Hungarian), could be because Romania is mostly inland where the soil is not as attractive to Slavic settlers as much as Ukranian or Bulgarian soil but that’s a very rough theory and a very separate rabbit hole.</p>

<p>Additional European names for Roma come from the Sanskrit kala, meaning “black”, probably because of their darker skin and hair. Because different languages have different names for Roma living in their lands, English sometimes Anglicizes the words of other languages, Tzigane meaning specifically Hungarian Roma and Kale meaning specifically Welsh and Finnish Roma originally come from the Greek Athínganos and Sanskrit kala respectively. The Greek word is also the source of the English Antiziganism, which is the hostility or prejudice directed at Roma.</p>

<p>The underlying interesting fact is how one general people group introduced so many words and meanings to the English language because they were so misunderstood by so many different people. From exonyms of the Roma we got words and meanings like Gypsy, Bohemian, and Antiziganism, and these all came from the incorrect guesses of where the Roma were from. Unfortunately, this lack of understanding often results in discrimination and mass misconception.</p>

<p>Oh, and while we’re at it, let’s clear up some basic misconceptions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Generally, Roma is the term for the people and the group, while Romani or Romany refers to the culture or language.</li>
    <li>Roma have spread across all over the world but the culture and societal integration of each subgroup vary wildly, with some groups still living separately and travelling and others only simply having Romani heritage and living as part of the national society.</li>
    <li>Roma are the most famous, but not the only travelling dispersed people. Irish Travellers and New Age Travellers also commonly live in vehicles or wagons but otherwise many other nomadic groups (the most famous being the Mongols, the Bedouin, and the Sámi) still live nomadic lives. It is also believed that the Roma are related to the nomadic Dom of the Middle East by both being from the nomadic Domba of India.</li>
    <li>While the region with the most Roma is Eastern Europe, the single country with the most Roma is the US, followed by Brazil, Spain, then Romania.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, I am no expert of etymology nor the Romani people or culture. This is just two days of internet research from only moderately reliable sources.</p>
